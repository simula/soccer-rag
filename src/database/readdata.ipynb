      "445.040 448.040 Look where the VARLEY is installed.\n",
      "448.040 452.040 Evidently he is going to have bad stretches, he is going to suffer a lot.\n",
      "452.040 454.040 And that he is going to suffer the attacks of Chelsea.\n",
      "454.040 460.040 And he's going to have to lower the VARICENTRO, his VARICENTRO the team.\n",
      "460.040 466.040 But as long as it can, the team keeps the lines at a good height.\n",
      "467.040 469.040 Boit arrives, he didn't think twice.\n",
      "469.040 471.040 He jumped on Felipe.\n",
      "473.040 477.040 That is, the idea is not to lock yourself in.\n",
      "477.040 482.040 Evidently if a team locks itself in it is almost impossible for it to get anything positive.\n",
      "482.040 485.040 You can lock yourself in but you have to deploy at a given moment.\n",
      "485.040 490.040 The VARLEY is trying, look, here it is again, not to bother too much.\n",
      "491.040 493.040 Jones had recovered the ball.\n",

      "522.040 524.040 He's not finding Fabregas either.\n",
      "525.040 531.040 There are many people out there from VARLEY who are upset about Chelsea's clean exit.\n",
      "531.040 535.040 They indicated a foul to Diego Costa who was looking directly at the assistant\n",

      "2175.040 2177.040 Chelsea came out with a simple touch,\n",

      "2213.040 2214.040 Leave the leg to Burns.\n",

      "2255.040 2256.040 This is the action of the goal.\n",
      "2257.040 2260.040 The moment this player starts, everything is possible.\n",
      "2261.040 2264.040 I think it's also a bit of a blow, I don't know if it's a semi-final,\n",
      "2265.040 2268.040 He hits it with his ankle more than his foot, Ivanovic gives me the feeling there.\n",
      "2269.040 2271.040 Actually it fits perfectly, because as it enters...\n",
      "2274.040 2276.040 But what a move by Hasard.\n",

      "2289.040 2297.040 Because of what it means to open the game, to break a tied duel.\n",
      "2298.040 2305.040 This goal is valuable, as is the one during the week at the Parc des Princes for Chelsea.\n",

      "2309.040 2313.040 He made that goal profitable from that minute until the end of the match.\n",
      "2314.040 2316.040 In fact, Chelsea didn't want to play anymore from then on.\n",
      "2317.040 2321.040 He proposed to defend and when the tie occurred he proposed the tie.\n",

      "2344.040 2345.040 Chelsea wins 1-0.\n",

      "2351.040 2357.040 But without yet having assured victory, victory.\n",
      "2358.040 2361.040 Because the marker is so minimal.\n",
      "2362.040 2365.040 Anything that involves winning 1-0 is always very dangerous.\n",

      "2382.040 2383.040 It's extreme right now.\n",

      "2398.040 2399.040 Another tough inning.\n",
